ðŸ“Š Instagram Social Media Dashboard
<br>
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:<br>
This project creates a social media dashboard to analyze user engagement on Instagram posts. It fetches data from the Instagram API, stores it in a database, and visualizes the insights.
<br>
<br>
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:<br>
The goal of this project is to track Instagram post engagement by fetching and analyzing data. This helps understand likes, comments, and trends over time.
<br>
<br>
ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
APIs: Instagram Graph API
Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (to store data)
Data Visualization: Tableau / Power BI
Libraries Used: requests (to fetch API data), json (to parse API responses), pandas (for data analysis), matplotlib (for basic data visualization)
<br>
<br>
ðŸ”‘ Skills Learned:
How to authenticate and connect with the Instagram API<br>
How to fetch and parse JSON data from an API<br>
How to store and manage data in a database<br>
How to analyze and visualize engagement trends<br>
<br>
<br>
ðŸ“Œ Project Steps:<br>
Authenticate with Instagram API: Use OAuth2 to access Instagram data.<br>
Fetch User Engagement Data: Get likes, comments, and other metrics for posts.<br>
Store Data in a Database: Save the fetched data in SQLite or PostgreSQL.<br>
Analyze and Visualize Data: Use Tableau or Power BI to create charts and insights.<br>
<br>
<br>
âœ… Project Outcome:
Successfully built a dashboard that tracks and visualizes Instagram engagement.<br>
Gained experience in working with APIs, databases, and data visualization tools.<br>
<br>
<br>
âš¡ Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them:<br>
1.API Authentication Issues<br>
Problem: OAuth2 authentication was complex and required tokens.<br>
Solution: Followed Instagramâ€™s API documentation and tested requests using Postman.<br>
<br>
2.Handling API Rate Limits<br>
Problem: Too many API requests caused temporary access blocks.<br>
Solution: Implemented request delays and efficient data fetching strategies.<br>
<br>
3.Storing & Managing Data<br>
Problem: Storing large data sets in a structured way was challenging.<br>
Solution: Used PostgreSQL for better management and indexing.<br>
<br>
4.Creating Effective Visualizations<br>
Problem: Choosing the right charts and graphs for engagement trends.<br>
Solution: Experimented with Tableau and Power BI to find the best way to present data<br>
