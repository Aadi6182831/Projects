Real-Time Weather Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This project is a real-time weather dashboard that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city. By entering a city name, users can instantly fetch details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions using the OpenWeather API.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:
The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with API requests and JSON parsing while building a functional and interactive weather dashboard.


ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used: 1.Programming Language: Python 2.APIs: OpenWeather API 3.Libraries: requests (for making API calls), json (for parsing API responses)


ðŸ”‘ Skills Learned: 1.How to fetch data from a REST API 2.JSON data parsing and processing 3.Handling user input for dynamic API requests 4.Displaying real-time data in a structured format


ðŸ“Œ Project Steps: 1.Fetch Weather Data: Send a request to the OpenWeather API to retrieve real-time weather information. 2.Parse API Response: Extract key details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions from the JSON response. 3.User Input Handling: Allow users to enter a city name to fetch weather details dynamically. 4.Display Results: Present the weather information in a readable format.


âœ… Project Outcome: 1.Successfully built a working weather dashboard where users can check real-time weather details for any city. 2.Gained practical experience in working with REST APIs and handling JSON data.


âš¡ Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them:
1.Handling API Errors (Invalid City Input) Challenge: When users entered an incorrect city name, the API returned an error. Solution: Implemented error handling to display a friendly message instead of crashing the program.

2.Understanding JSON Parsing Challenge: Extracting specific values from the API response was initially confusing. Solution: Used Pythonâ€™s json module and practiced printing different parts of the JSON response to understand its structure.

3.Rate Limits & API Key Management Challenge: The free OpenWeather API has rate limits that restrict the number of requests per minute. Solution: Implemented a delay between multiple requests and explored alternative free APIs for testing.
